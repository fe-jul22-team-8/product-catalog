# About
- During this team project, the client and server part of the project were implemented. On the client's side, the display of a `page with a list of phones` with pagination, and a `shopping cart page` displaying the products added to it, with the possibility of removing or adding them, was implemented. On the server side, the placement of the server on Heroku and the uploading of the phone database to the client was implemented.
- During the creation of this project, such technologies were used as: `React.js`, `Node.js`, `Husky`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `SCSS/SASS`.
